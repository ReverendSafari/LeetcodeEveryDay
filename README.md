# Leetcode Every Day
My interview prep journey! I am currently a rising senior at the new college of florida and I need to start applying to SE jobs this summer. I really want to be prepared if I can get any interviews so I am starting this repo to try and motivate myself to practice as much as possible.

My goal by the end of summer is to comfortably solve atleast HALF of the neetcode 150.

Wish me luck and follow below for my progress, solutions, struggles, and thoughts/strategies.
